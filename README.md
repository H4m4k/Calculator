Hello Reader

This is my own project to create a working calculator with the use of my JS knowledge gained to this day.  
I have been learning the JavaScript for two months now. Foundation of my knowledge has been built by learning from MDN JS Tutorials, and is expanded with Learnjavascript.online course.

I am not using any tutorials or other guidance to create the calculator, just my own ideas and thoughts ( using stackoverflow is not cheating , as long as i search for the problem at hand, and not for solution to writing a calc :) ). 

The main goal is to take the first step into programming world and work my way to changing my everyday job from sales to IT.
